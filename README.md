# aes

AES is an implementation of the [Advanced Encryption Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) cipher

# BUILD

Run `make clean && make` inside `\aes`

Run `./build/aes`

That should generate your `encrypted.txt` and `decrypted.txt`, which you can find inside `\aes`

The text used for encryption is inside `input.txt`

# NOTES

This implementation is based on [this paper](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.197.pdf) and is coded by me(not plagiarized).

Not suitable for production use :)
